description: Debug hooks to trace component renderings

# useWhyDidYouUpdate

This hooks will create a log in the console whenever a component is rerendered by props changed.
The log will show which component is rendered and which prop have been modified.

This hook is not meant to be used in production (it's a debug hook) although it's possible.

:::note

The hook will not log anything on the component first render (mount).

:::

:::tip

This is a debug hook. You don't need to have it installed on your project dependencies,
you can have in its devDependencies (if you don't use any production hook of this package).

This way, you will have a notification if you try to build your project without having cleaned this hook usages.

:::

## Usage

```tsx
const MyComponent = (props: MyComponentPros) => {
    
    useWhyDidYouUpdate("ChildComponent", props)

    return (
        <>...</>
    )
}
```

## Result

To see the results, open your browser's DevTools. The hooks will log all changed properties on a formatted group.

export const LogExample = () => (
    <div className="codeBlockContainer_node_modules-\@docusaurus-theme-classic-lib-theme-CodeBlock-Container-styles-module">
