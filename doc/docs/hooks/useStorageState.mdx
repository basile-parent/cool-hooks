description: An alternative "useState" hook storing the data in the browser storage
---

# useStorageState

This hook is acting just like `useState` except the state is stored in the browser storage, 
allowing your component to persist its state among the refreshes.

The initial state provided to the hook will be used only if there is no value already stored in the browser.

:::note

The state is saved to the browser storage on each "setState" call.
The initial state is NOT stored in the storage.

:::

## Usage

```tsx
const MyComponent = ({ prop1 }: MyComponentProps) => {
    
    const [myState, setMyState] = useStorageState("storage_key", "default_value", { storageMethod: "localStorage", synced: true })
    
    return (
        <>...</>
    )
}
```

| Parameter      | Description                                                                                 |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| *key*          | The key used for the browser storage.                                                       |
| *initialState* | *(optional)* The state initial value (only when there is no value in storage for this key). |
| *options*      | *(optional)* The hook options (see the [Options](#options) section).                        |

## Options

### storageMethod
- **Type:** `"localStorage" | "sessionStorage"`
- **Default:** `"localStorage"`

Choose where you want to store your state:
- localStorage: the state is shared between tabs and persist when tabs are closed. 
The state could be synchronized between opened tabs with the `synced` option.
- sessionStorage: the state is scoped to the current tab. It will be lost when the tab is closed.
The state could not be synchronized.

### synced
- **Type:** `boolean`
- **Default:** `false`

If set to `true` with a `localStorage` storageMethod, the state is synchronized between tabs of a **same browser**.
This means that when you change your state on a tab, all tabs implementing the same state (based on the `storageKey` prop) will be updated.

:::note

If set to `true` with a `sessionStorage` storageMethod, you will have a warning on your console.
