# useDidUpdateEffect

This hooks act and have the same syntax as the `useEffect` hook. The only difference is the callback does not execute on the first render.
It will then be executed each time the dependencies have changed

:::tip

Using a void array as dependency will ends to a pointless hook as it will never be executed

```jsx
useDidUpdateEffect(() => {
    // Never been called
}, [])
```

:::

## Usage

```tsx
const MyComponent = ({ prop1 }: MyComponentProps) => {
    
    useDidUpdateEffect(() => {
        console.log("prop1 has changed", prop1)
    }, [ prop1 ])

    return (
        <>...</>
    )
}
```

This hook is designed to be used just as `useEffect`.
