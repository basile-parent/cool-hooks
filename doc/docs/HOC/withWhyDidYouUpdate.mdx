# withWhyDidYouUpdate

:::info

This HOC has the exact same behaviour as the [useWhyDidYouUpdate](/docs/hooks/useDidUpdateEffect) HOC.

:::

This HOC will create a log in the console whenever a component is rerendered by props changed.
The log will show which component is rendered and which prop have been modified.

This HOC is not meant to be used in production (it's a debug HOC) although it's possible.

:::note

The HOC will not log anything on the component first render (mount).

:::

:::tip

This is a debug HOC. You don't need to have it installed on your project dependencies,
you can have in its devDependencies (if you don't use any production HOC of this package).

This way, you will have a notification if you try to build your project without having cleaned this HOC usages.

:::

## Usage

```tsx
const MyComponent = (props: MyComponentPros) => {
    return (
        <>...</>
    )
}

export default withWhyDidYouUpdate(MyComponent)
```

| Parameter   | Description                                                                           |
|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| *Component* | The component to watch.                                                               |

## Result

To see the results, open your browser's DevTools. The HOCs will log all changed properties on a formatted group.

export const LogExample = () => (
